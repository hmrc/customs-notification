### Body
The body of the request will contain the XML payload. 

## Configuring `Authorization` header check

To configure the service to accept requests only with specific value in `Authorization` header with `Basic` authentication scheme, the configuration key `auth.token.internal` should be defined with required value.

### Example
Accept only requests having the header `Authorization: Basic YmFzaWN1c2VyOmJhc2ljcGFzc3dvcmQ=`

    auth.token.internal = "YmFzaWN1c2VyOmJhc2ljcGFzc3dvcmQ="

## Switching service endpoints

Dynamic switching of service endpoints has been implemented for connectors. To configure dynamic
switching of the endpoint there must be a corresponding section in the application config file
(see example below). This should contain the endpoint config details.

### Example
The service `api-subscription-fields` has a `default` configuration and a `stub` configuration. Note
that `default` configuration is declared directly inside the `api-subscription-fields` section.

    {
        ...
        services {
          ...

          api-subscription-fields {
            host = localhost
            port = 9650
            context = /field
    
            stub {
              host = localhost
              port = 9477
              context = /api-subscription-fields/fields
            }
          }
        }
    }

## Set stub configuration for service

## Set default configuration for service

### Request

    curl -X "POST" http://customs-notification-host/test-only/service/api-subscription-fields/configuration -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ "environment": "default" }'

### Response

## Get the current configuration for a service

### REQUEST

    curl -X "GET" http://customs-notification-host/test-only/service/api-subscription-fields/configuration

### RESPONSE

    {
      "service": "api-subscription-fields",
      "environment": "stub",
      "url": "http://currenturl/api-subscription-fields"
      "bearerToken": "current token"
    }


## Scheduled Email
A warning email is sent when the scheduler finds notifications for configurable clientIds (`pull.exclude.csIds`) in the database that are more than `pull.exclude.older.milliseconds` plus `push.polling.delay.duration.milliseconds` old.
The check is currently configured (`pull.exclude.email.interval.duration.minutes`) to run every 30 minutes. The set of email "to" addresses are configured with `pull.exclude.email.addresses`.
